# CentOS7-Setup
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/7ZdMO5G.png)

The goal of this repo is to provide information to setup a development workstation for Software Developer.

## Overall idea
Sometimes you need to work on multiple programming languages and frameworks some works better with Windows and some works better with Linux.

Creating a stable environment to work on all projects is the main goal. 
The two main OS are going to be:

 - CentOS 7
 - Windows 10 Pro 64 Bits

Inside CentOS 7, I am going to create a virtual machine that will be used as a development environment for Linux project.


## Current Built

I have built a workstation ready to handle mulltiple vms:

 - [Two Xeon E5-2670](https://ark.intel.com/products/64595/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2670-20M-Cache-2_60-GHz-8_00-GTs-Intel-QPI)
