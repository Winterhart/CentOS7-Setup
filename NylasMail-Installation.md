![enter image description here](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/uploads/2/1/1/5/21152474/nylas-mail-review_orig.jpg)I like Nylas mail application I've decided to use it as the main Mail Application. First let's download the .rpm file at: https://www.nylas.com/download
Let's login as root with:

    su

Then let's navigate to the download folder

    cd ~/Downloads

After let's install the Nylas using the .rpm file

    rpm -ivh NylasMail.rpm
